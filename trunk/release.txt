## Full Release ##
r11 - Switching to Revision/Build numbers from Subversion / Google Code

## Beta Phase ##
b.1 - Fixed the drop-down so that it always shows next week.

## Alpha Phase ##
a.7 - Fixed 'eob' calculator
      Readded 'selecteduseronshiftcell' and 'selectedusercell' classes for more CSS flexibility, currently set same as default
	  Corrected and added functionality that will automatically compensate for DST.
	  The drop-down menu for date selection is now populated with dates from the begining of case counts or schedule to current date
	  --This drop-down used to only be populated with weeks that contained data making it impossible to get to a week w/o data
	  Added case notes section to index page
	  Added case rules section to index page	  
	  Added new management page
	  --Added case notes modification field
	  --Added case rules modification field
	  --Added site title modification field
	  --Added password modification fields
	  Changed the site name so that it is no longer set by the variables file and is now set by the database - so it can be changed

a.6.1 - Added DST_VALUE as a global and changed from 1 to a 0 to compensate for DST time.
        This exposed a bug with the 'eob' calculator

a.6 - Added the ability to press return and submit form in MSIE using JavaScript
      Fixed an issue with really late data entries times showing for next day, when not passed midnight

a.5 - Added a legend so that if a user isn't selected the users could still see what the colors mean when details are shown
      A click on details would not show details until enter was pressed - change OnChange to OnClick
      Changed the user selection area to stay with the DIV page, not the top right corner of the browser
      Changing User, Timezone, or Details would force the page to reload twice, now only one reload is required
      --This was due to the site being dependent on a Cookie being set. Cookies need to be set and the page needs to be reloaded
      --To fix this I use a common variable set in the SET_COOKIES function that works on either a passed variable or the cookie
      Updated cookies to remember user information for 365 days
      --The password is refreshed for 7 days every time the page is loaded so that does not need to be set
      Changed the type from GET to POST for all forms except date - leaving selectdate as GET for backdoor to change date to any date
      Added the '----' default user back to the list of users so that if a user gets selected, the user could de-select the currently selected user
      Changed the links in the Users page to forms and changed them to post
      Added a confim dialog if a user is going to be permenantly deleted

a.4 - The CSS type attribute was set to text/plain which caused IE and FF to not show the page with CSS changed to text/css

a.3 - Changed the Current History table highlight of on-queue users from Lavender to Wheat
      Removed highlighting for the entire user row in the current history table
      Changed the default timezone to MST, and removed GMT time all together
      Added the ability to hide details
      Added Transfer Out
      Changed Schedule page to submit on changes
      Added JavaScipt to hide buttons so if user does not have javascipt they can still submit tables
      --This changes seems to have slowed down the load times and is causing errors - hides all buttons for all pages, but all buttons are not present on current page
      --Possible future change will use local JS calls to hide button after each button is added
      Users were displayed in order of userID, they now are displayed in order of UserName

a.2 - Added CSS to cleanup the look 

a.1 - Initial release, with basic functionality
